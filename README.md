# 🤖 LLM Brand Perception Analyzer

A Streamlit-based tool that queries open-weight LLMs (like LLaMA3 or Mistral via Ollama) to analyze **how brands are perceived by AI models**. It extracts brand mentions and rationales from LLM responses and applies **sentiment analysis** to understand the tone of those mentions — giving you a clear view of brand perception through the lens of modern AI.
